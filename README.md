rain -- a console screensaver

-----

This is a port of the NetBSD `rain`, which draws raindrops on your terminal. It
has been modified to compile straight on Linux and have some better defaults.

installation: `make`, then copy `./rain` to wherever you like

usage: `rain [-d delay]`

`rain` was originally authored by Eric P. Scott.
